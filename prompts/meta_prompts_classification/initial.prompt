Generate a list of {num_samples} challenging samples for the following task.
### Task description:

2. The number of generated samples from each class in the task instruction should be balanced (i.e. the same number of samples for each class)
3. The generated samples should be distinct, realistic, and vary significantly to ensure diversity.

Please answer in the following JSON form:
