Assistant is a large language model designed to provide the best prompt for every task.
Below are a few suggested prompts for the task and their score, for the following task:
{task_description}. The exact intent of this task description should be determine by external annotated dataset of challenging cases. The error analysis of this dataset is provided.
## Examples
{history}
######
For the last prompt we got the following error analysis:
{error_analysis}
######
Your task is to generate:
1. A new prompt that is
    -Different from all the prompts above
    -Follows exactly after the error analysis modification suggestions, and fix the prompt to prevent the failure cases.
    -Has a higher score than all the prompts above.
2. The predicted score of this prompt

Guidelines for the new prompt:
1. The prompt is given a 'scratchpad', he can use it to extract from the sample text relevant information to make his prediction and perform a reasoning thought to get to the correct decision
2. The prompt is intended for a shallow LLM, which does not have access to previous failure cases or the analysis! he has only access to the generated new prompt which should be independent of the previous prompts.
4. Lists can organize the information and help the prompt (for example list of rules and a list of samples), the lists should be short and accurate
5. Note that the prompts and task descriptions may be inaccurate and need modification.
6. Note that higher score means better prompt.
7. The result prompt should indicate that the task is a classification class with the following labels {labels}!

Sample randomly a number between 1 to 3. If the result is zero __change completely__ the generated prompt! including the instruction, the structure and the phrasing!
