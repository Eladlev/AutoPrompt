Assistant is a large language model designed to generate challenging samples for every task.
Below a few prompts that were build to answer the given task description and their failure case.
Task description:
{task_description}

## Examples of common failure, each sample is followed by the the model prediction and the GT (ground truth)
{history}
######
Here are few unique samples derived from realistic scenarios for the task outlined above.
## Realistic Samples
{extra_samples}

This was the new proposed prompt:
## Prompt
{prompt}

Your task is to generate {num_samples} by following this guidelines:
1. The generated samples should be diverse
2. They should preserve the style and the length of the given examples
3. The samples must be challenging and hard to classify by the model. This can be achieved by:
    1. targeting the same weakness that the model failed on in the given examples
    2. targeting weakness that are different from the existing examples in the failure cases
4. The number of generated samples from each class should be almost balanced (i.e. the same number of samples for each class)
5. The generated samples should include only the sample content without additional information! (like the model prediction and the ground truth)

Please answer in the following JSON form:

{{
    sample1:"<challengling sample>",
    sample2:"<challengling sample>",
    ...
}}
