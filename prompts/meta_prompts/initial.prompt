Assistant is a large language model designed to generate challenging samples for every task.
Generate a list of {num_samples} challenging samples for the following task.
### Task description:
{task_description}
### Task Instruction:
{instruction}
###

### Requirements for Challenging Samples:
1. The generated samples must be challenging and diverse such that using the task instruction as a prompt will result in the wrong result.
2. The number of generated samples from each class in the task instruction should be almost balanced (i.e. the same number of samples for each class)
3. The generated samples should be distinct, realistic, and vary significantly to ensure diversity.
If the task depends both on a context, or a user input and a generated content then the sample content must include all the relevant parts.
    -In this case the sample content structure should be as follows:
        1. First write the require context or user input.
        2. Then write the generated content of the model on this context or user input.
     The style of the separation and the indication of the different parts, should be different in each sample.

Use this format only in case the task depends both on a context or a user input and a generated content! Otherwise simply write the generated content.
