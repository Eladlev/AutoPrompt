This does not mean that your customer makes two payments.

The authorization (pending charge) appears on your customer's bank statement and may look like a charge, however, no funds are actually taken at that time.The authorization should disappear from online bank statements within a month. If the authorization does not disappear, please advise your customer to contact their bank for further information.Note:Charges are made in different currencies depending on the locations of both you and your customer.

While card-on-file transactions can make it easier to complete transactions in certain circumstances, you must remember to use this payment method correctly to avoid charging customers unexpectedly. There are two ways to save a customer's credit or debit cards. One is to let customers select that option during checkout. The other is to save a customer's card while you manually enter credit card details, which should happen only with customer consent. Once a card is saved, you can use it to collect payment for future orders, as long as you retain your customer's consent to do so.

how do i decide which Wix plan is right for me?,"Wix Blocks: Setting Up and Managing Your App's Pricing\nWix Blocks is currently open to a limited number of users. When you publish your Blocks app in the Wix App Market (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-blocks-publishing-your-app-to-the-app-market) through the Wix Developers Center, you choose to provide different app behaviors for site-creators with different pricing. For example, people who download a free version of your app may get several services, while those who pay for it, get more. This requires creating and managing a system that identifies the user, determines their pricing plan and impacts the app's behavior. Before you begin: configure pricing in the Wix Developers CenterWix Developers Center 1 | Select a business model\n Free: This model can get lots of people using your app, helping to grow your user base and brand. There should be no additional costs anywhere in your app \u2013 if you want to charge a fee later on you will need to change your business model. Freemium: Offer a basic version for free and encourage users to upgrade for additional, premium features. Premium: Users pay for your app from the start, either by monthly / yearly recurring payments or a one-off fee for a service or standalone package. Dynamic Pricing: This model lets you charge flexible rates for your app. For example, you can offer a pay per use model, or define your own pricing structure. This pricing plan requires adding your external payment page and checkout (https://devforum.wix.com/kb/en/article/add-your-app-pricing#5-optional-set-up-an-external-pricing-page-and-checkout), outside of the Wix system.For every plan, you can also add In app purchases (https://devforum.wix.com/kb/en/article/add-your-app-pricing#offer-in-app-purchases-one-time-payment). A free trial (https://devforum.wix.com/kb/en/article/add-your-app-pricing#2-choose-whether-to-offer-a-free-trial) is currently not available in Blocks.Wix Developers Center 2 | Add your pricing plansThe Wix Developers Center allows you to add four pricing plans to your business model. For example, a \""Freemium\"" app can have Free, Basic, Advanced and Pro plans. Set up these plans and describe their benefits and features.Note: If you want to allow a one-time payment (in-app purchase), you must add a Dashboard component and add OAuth (https://devforum.wix.com/kb/en/article/set-up-oauth-permissions-and-webhooks). Learn more about adding and setting up your pricing plans (https://devforum.wix.com/kb/en/article/add-your-app-pricing#3-add-pricing-plans)Wix Developers Center 3 | Set up your pricing page and checkoutThe Pricing Page is how a user chooses and pays for an upgrade after they've installed an app. It shows all the key features of each paid plan. Wix allows you to manage pricing and payments using Wix pricing and checkout. If you want to host it yourself, read the external pricing page and checkout (https://devforum.wix.com/en/article/set-up-an-external-pricing-page) guide. Learn more about setting up your pricing page and checkout (https://devforum.wix.com/kb/en/article/add-your-app-pricing#4-set-up-a-wix-pricing-page-and-checkout)Adjust your Blocks app to the pricing plansConfiguring the pricing settings in the Wix Developers Center is only a first step. Now, you need to adjust your app to handle this pricing plan with your own logic and UI. This includes four steps: \n Create a different user interface (UI) for the different plans (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-blocks-setting-up-and-managing-your-apps-pricing#step-1-creating-a-user-interface-ui-for-the-different-plans) Code how your app behaves with the different plans (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-blocks-setting-up-and-managing-your-apps-pricing#step-2-code) Optional: make some configuration adjustments (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-blocks-setting-up-and-managing-your-apps-pricing#step-3-configuration) Optional: customize your panels (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-blocks-setting-up-and-managing-your-apps-pricing#step-4-customize-your-panels) Optional: change the installation (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-blocks-setting-up-and-managing-your-apps-pricing#step-4-app-and-widget-installation-settings)settings (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-blocks-setting-up-and-managing-your-apps-pricing#step-4-app-and-widget-installation-settings)In this article, we use an example app that shows numbers moving upwards, like in a slot machine. See example applicationClick the example application template (https://editor.wix.com/_api/wix-blocks-service/web/v1/sites/new?editorType=RESPONSIVE&amp;originTemplateId=a51d653d-8db4-4534-a6f2-824e3a261d97&amp;http_referrer=documentation) and build it in Blocks to create your own copy of the application. The template gives you:\n The widgets design and code The panels and configuration settingsThe template does not give you the following (define them on your own): \n Installations settings Pricing settings in the Wix Developers CenterStep 1 | Creating a user interface (UI) for the different plansSince your app needs to behave differently to users according to their different pricing plans, the first thing you should understand is what the different users see. You can do this through a multi-state box (https://support.wix.com/en/article/editor-x-using-multi-state-boxes), or through deleting and restoring elements with the delete() and restore() functions. A multi-state box can give you different user interfaces with no code at all. Should I use a mutli-state box or delete() and restore() ? \n If you want a completely different behavior in the different plans, it's best to choose a multi-state box. If most of the behavior is similar, and you want to modify just several specific elements - use delete() and restore(). Step 2 | CodeUse the following in your widget code to impact your widget's behavior. Your app's JWTWhen your Blocks app is installed on a site, it generates a Jason Web Token (JWT) for that app instance. The JWT has two fields that are important for this process: \n appDefId: Your app's ID vendorProductId: The ID of the pricing plan in use, as you configured in the Wix Developers Center. If there is no plan - this ID is null. getDecodedAppInstance()This function is part of the wix-application module and is used for parsing your app's JWT. See API reference (https://www.wix.com/velo/reference/wix-application/getdecodedappinstance?utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_campaign=13708482663^124757113632&amp;experiment_id=^^530755701296^^_DSA&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw8symBhAqEiwAaTA__Opbaej4Mz91N_ANHXR3YdIfGvVBLK50mPCvguckVBrKOJfVxE5FBRoCbekQAvD_BwE)The function signature is: getDecodedAppInstance(): Promise&lt;DecodedAppInstance&gt;The object in the return promise has returns this type: type DecodedAppInstance = {\nappDefId: string;\nexpirationDate?: string;\ninstanceId: string;\nvendorProductId?: string;\n};Import the wix-application module in order to process this information. import wixApplication from 'wix-application'Use getDecodedAppInstance() to get the vendorProductId and use it in your code logic.import wixApplication from 'wix-application';\n\n$w.onReady(async function () {\n instance = await wixApplication.getDecodedAppInstance();\n plan = instance.vendorProductId;\n //You configured vendorProductId in the Wix Developers Center. \n //If there is no plan, the value is null. \n // Now, add your logic for the different plans\n});\n\n$widget.onPropsChanged((oldProps, newProps) =&gt; {\n});\n\nNoteYou can also import wix-application in your app's backend (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-blocks-adding-code-files-and-folders-to-your-app#add-backend-files) files. Step 3 | ConfigurationNow, you might want to make some changes in the Configuration tab in Blocks. You can define certain elements of your widget, such as the grid, as non-selectable. You can also change display names. Make sure to think about all your pricing plans when making these changes. Note:Once you define a pricing plan for your app your widget automatically gets an Upgrade button in its action bar.Learn more about configuring widget and element display names and behavior (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-blocks-configuring-widget-and-elements-display-names-and-behavior). Step 4 | Customize your panelsYou can get the vendorProductId of the app and show or hide elements in the panel according to the plan in the Panel code, just like you did in the widget code. This is done in the code section of your panel in the Panels tab. Step 5 | App and widget installation settingsYour app installation settings allow you to control what widgets are seen in a site's Add panel, and more options. Make sure to think about all your pricing plans when you go over your installation settings. For example, there are some widgets that you might want to hide from the Add Elements panel.Learn more about app and widget installation settings (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-blocks-app-and-widget-installation-settings).Congratulations, your app is ready to publish!

Deleting a site member cancels their pricing plan automatically. What happens if I delete, transfer or duplicate my site?Deleting your site cancels all subscriptions. Transferring or duplicating your site doesn't cancel existing subscriptions on the original site. You must cancel original plans and create new ones for your clients to purchase on any duplicated and transferred sites. What happens after a client's plan is canceled?This depends on the type of plan that was canceled: \n Free / one-time payment: Access to services and content stops immediately. For example, if you cancel a monthly plan after 2 weeks, the client would not have access to services/content for the last 2 weeks of the month. Recurring: After a client cancels a recurring plan, the plan's status is changed to \u201cpending cancellation\u201d until the end of the billing period the client paid for. \n\nWhen you cancel a recurring payment, the purchased plan and payment does not continue for the next cycle. For example, if you cancel a monthly plan in the middle of January, the plan continues until the end of January, but does not recur in the following months. During January, in this example, the Plan Status will be \""Pending Cancellation\"".Can I offer refunds for canceled plans?Note: Refunding a plan does not cancel it, you can cancel a plan in Subscriptions (https://www.wix.com/my-account/site-selector/?buttonText=View%20Purchased%20Plans&amp;title=Select%20a%20Site&amp;autoSelectOnSingleSite=true&amp;actionUrl=https://www.wix.com/dashboard/{{metaSiteId}}/membership/orders) in your site dashboard.Contact your payment provider to offer refunds for canceled plans (e.g. PayPal, Stripe, etc.).Can I allow clients to cancel only specific plans?You can allow clients to cancel plans themselves in the settings section of each plan.

i would like to request a refund for the plan i bought,"Creating a Terms and Conditions Policy\nTerms and conditions (\u201cTerms\u201d) are a set of legal terms defined by the owner of a website. They set forth the terms and conditions governing the activities of the website visitors on the said website and the relationship between the site visitors and the website owner. Terms must be defined according to the specific needs and nature of each website. For example, a website offering products to customers in e-commerce transactions requires Terms that are different than the Terms of a website only providing information. The Terms are an agreement between the website owner and the users of the website; they detail the policies and procedures conducted by the website. In many ways, the Terms provide the website owner the ability to protect themselves from potential legal exposure.In addition, there are legal obligations to notify the website users of such activities, and in many cases the Terms are the place to do so.It is therefore very important and highly recommended for websites to have clear and comprehensive Terms that are adjusted and tailored to the specific website and its activities. Important:The explanations and information provided herein are only general and high-level explanations, information and samples. You should not rely on this article as legal advice or as recommendations regarding what you should actually do. We recommend that you seek legal advice to help you understand and to assist you in the creation of your Terms. What should you cover in your Terms?The following is a list of issues that are typically dealt with in Terms for websites. Of course, some of the issues may not be relevant to your website (e.g. refund policies are not relevant for a website that does not sell anything) and there may be terms required for your website that are not mentioned below. The following is only a limited, high-level outline and illustration of main issues typically dealt with in Terms for websites. Website owner, the offering, and binding of TermsAs in every agreement, the Terms need to clearly state the owner of the website, what the website offers and the Terms being a binding agreement upon the users of the website. If the website is operated by a legal entity, it is important to state the full and precise name of such entity (and not the commercial name used for business activity). It is also important to define what is offered on the website and to state that the Terms are a legal agreement controlling the use of the website by visitors and users of the services.Sample:This website is owned and operated by [name of your website operator]. These Terms set forth the terms and conditions under which you may use our website and services as offered by us. This website offers visitors [description of what is offered on your website]. By accessing or using the website of our service, you approve that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms.Who can use your website; what are the requirements to create an accountYou must define who is entitled and who is permitted to use the website and the services, and when relevant, what the requirements are for opening an account. Sample:In order to use our website and/or receive our services, you must be at least [add number] years of age, or of the legal age of majority in your jurisdiction, and possess the legal authority, right and freedom to enter into these Terms as a binding agreement. You are not allowed to use this website and/or receive services if doing so is prohibited in your country or under any law or regulation applicable to you.Key commercial Terms offered to customersIf the website includes sale of products and/or services, the Terms must include the main commercial terms for purchasing or licensing of such services. For example, if the website offers subscriptions to a product or service, the Terms need to define the terms of such licensing, the payable fees, and terms of subscription renewal. If the website offers physical products or goods, the Terms should define general supply terms (such as shipment, returns and product warranties).Sample:When buying an item, you agree that: (i) you are responsible for reading the full item listing before making a commitment to buy it: (ii) you enter into a legally binding contract to purchase an item when you commit to buy an item and you complete the check-out payment process.The prices we charge for using our services / for our products are listed on the website. We reserve the right to change our prices for products displayed at any time, and to correct pricing errors that may inadvertently occur. Additional information about pricing and sales tax is available on the payments page.\u201cThe fee for the services and any other charges you may incur in connection with your use of the service, such as taxes and possible transaction fees, will be charged on a monthly basis to your payment method.\nReturn and refund policyOnline businesses selling products are required to present their product return policy and refund policy. This is important in order to comply with consumer protection regulations. It avoids claims by customers that are not satisfied with products they purchase. Please note that many websites dealing with sale of physical goods establish a refund policy as a separate document. This normally includes more instructions and information on the procedures for returns and refunding.Sample:For any undamaged product, simply return it with its included accessories and packaging along with the original receipt (or gift receipt) within 14 days of the date you receive the product, and we will exchange it or offer a refund based upon the original payment method. In addition, please note the following: (i) Products can be returned only in the country in which they were originally purchased; and (ii) the following products are not eligible for return: [list of items]. Retention of right to change offeringIt is important to be able to change the offering on and/or through the website without being exposed to claims by the users of the website. Accordingly, Terms should include wording allowing the owner of the website to freely change the services and products offered on the website. Sample:We may, without prior notice, change the services; stop providing the services or any features of the services we offer; or create limits for the services. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend access to the services without notice and liability for any reason, or for no reason.Warranties &amp; responsibility for services and productsWebsites offering services or selling products usually define their responsibility in relation to the services or products they are offering. Such responsibilities typically include warranties granted by the website operator and should be in compliance with local consumer protection laws. We recommended verifying such obligations with a professional.Sample:When we receive a valid warranty claim for a product purchased from us, we will either repair the relevant defect or replace the product. If we are unable to repair or replace the product within a reasonable time, the customer will be entitled to a full refund upon the prompt return of the product to us. We will pay for shipment of repaired or replaced products to customer and customer will be responsible for return shipment of the product to us.Ownership of intellectual property, copyrights and logosIn order to protect the rights of the website owner in its content, materials and products, it is important to include wording retaining all rights and emphasizing that the visitors and the customers of the website are not granted any such rights.Sample: The Service and all materials therein or transferred thereby, including, without limitation, software, images, text, graphics, logos, patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, photographs, audio, videos, music and all Intellectual Property Rights related thereto, are the exclusive property of [&gt;&gt;Name of website owner&lt;&lt;]. Except as explicitly provided herein, nothing in these Terms shall be deemed to create a license in or under any such Intellectual Property Rights, and you agree not to sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit or create derivative works thereof.If you want to offer to your users the ability to upload content (images, audio, text ...) for disclosure on your site, it is important that the issuer of such content certifies that he has all the legal rights and/or necessary licenses over the content and that such content might be public available.Sample:You recognize and agree that by uploading any content (including, but not limited to designs, images, animations, videos, audio files, fonts, logos, illustrations, compositions, artworks, interfaces, text and literary works) through any means to the website, you confirm that you own all the relevant rights or received the appropriate license to upload/transfer/send the content. You agree and consent that the uploaded/transferred content may be publicly displayed at the website.Right to suspend or cancel user accountWebsites need to be able to avoid misuse of the website by users and/or avoid exposure as a result of illegal activity conducted on the website (or by using a service or product offered by the website). Accordingly, websites offering subscription services or online services (such as SAAS) usually retain the ability to suspend or cancel the ability of a user or customer to use the website or the services. Sample:We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the service without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of these Terms or any applicable law or regulations. You may discontinue use and request to cancel your account and/or any services at any time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, with respect to automatically-renewed subscriptions to paid services, such subscriptions will be discontinued only upon the expiration of the respective period for which you have already made paymentIndemnificationWebsites must have the ability to seek indemnification from users and customers that cause damages to the website or its owners. The indemnity obligation is usually addressed in the Terms. The indemnification obligations need to be adjusted and be made fit to the potential exposure of each website according to its specific activities. Sample:You agree to indemnify and hold [website owner] harmless from any demands, loss, liability, claims or expenses (including attorneys\u2019 fees), made against them by any third party due to, or arising out of, or in connection with your use of the website or any of the services offered on the website.Limitation of liabilityIt is important to limit and fence the potential liability that the website owner may face as result of its business activities. Such limitations must be in compliance with local applicable laws (which may limit the ability to reduce liability). Sample: To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall [website owner], be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential or exemplary damages, including without limitation, damages for loss of profits, goodwill, use, data or other intangible losses, arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability to use, the service. \nTo the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, [website owner] assumes no liability or responsibility for any (i) errors, mistakes, or inaccuracies of content; (ii) personal injury or property damage, of any nature whatsoever, resulting from your access to or use of our service; and (iii) any unauthorized access to or use of our secure servers and/or any and all personal information stored therein.\nRight to change and modify TermsIn order to be able to change your Terms without requirement to receive the consent and approval of the Users, we recommend retaining the ability to change or modify the Terms at the website Owner\u2019s will.Sample:We reserve the right to modify these terms from time to time at our sole discretion. Therefore, you should review these page periodically. When we change the Terms in a material manner, we will notify you that material changes have been made to the Terms. Your continued use of the Website or our service after any such change constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future version of the Terms, do not use or access (or continue to access) the website or the service.Promotional emails and contentMany countries require that you receive the consent of your users before sending them promotional messages. The form of such consent and the legal requirements vary from country to country and therefore we recommend that you seek legal assistance on this subject.Sample:You agree to receive from time to time promotional messages and materials from us, by mail, email or any other contact form you may provide us with (including your phone number for calls or text messages). If you don't want to receive such promotional materials or notices \u2013 please just notify us at any time. Preference of law and dispute resolutionIt is important to define the laws and regulations under which the website and the business activities are acting. It is common to define the location of the courts that have jurisdiction over disputes between the website owner and any customer or user. Some Terms include provisions enforcing arbitration procedures as the sole dispute resolution mechanism. It is also possible to waive certain legal proceedings (such as a jury trial or class actions).Sample:These Terms, the rights and remedies provided hereunder, and any and all claims and disputes related hereto and/or to the services, shall be governed by, construed under and enforced in all respects solely and exclusively in accordance with the internal substantive laws of [Name of Country / State], without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Any and all such claims and disputes shall be brought in, and you hereby consent to them being decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in [Name of the city of the courts]. The application of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is hereby expressly excluded.Customer support details &amp; contact infoTerms are expected to have contact information enabling users and customers to receive customer support services and to correspond with the website and its operators.Provisions recommended for websites with user communitiesWix offers its users the ability to create communities for the users of their websites, in order to interact with such users in a better way. \nIf your website includes a user community, we recommend that the website Terms clarify that all users that join a community have a public profile that is publicly visible to site visitors, and that their public activity (such as their posts or comments) will be visible to other visitors of the website.It is important to explain, that a user of the website can always opt-out and exit the community, and upon doing so, such user\u2019s profile will not be publicly visible. Naturally, in such event the user will not be able to use the community features (e.g. liking, commenting or writing posts).Note:We recommend that you state the effective date of the Terms and update it every time there is a material change.",Irrelevant

live and preview site is not the same,"Wix Editor: Fixing Spacing and Alignment Issues on Your Site\nYou may notice issues with alignment and spacing on either your live site or in the Editor, such as gaps, text rendering, or overlapping elements.Read this article to learn about potential issues and their resolutions.In this article, learn more about:\n Misaligned elements on certain browsers (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-fixing-spacing-and-alignment-issues-on-your-site#alignment-issues-on-different-browsers) Gaps between the page content and footer (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-fixing-spacing-and-alignment-issues-on-your-site#gaps-between-the-page-content-and-footer) Gaps below the footer on the live site (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-fixing-spacing-and-alignment-issues-on-your-site#gaps-below-the-footer) Footers overlapping elements set to show on all pages (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-fixing-spacing-and-alignment-issues-on-your-site#footer-overlapping-elements-set-to-show-on-all-pages) Elements disappearing from your site header (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-fixing-spacing-and-alignment-issues-on-your-site#elements-disappearing-from-the-site-header) Misaligned text and elements on your live site (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-fixing-spacing-and-alignment-issues-on-your-site#text-misaligned-on-your-live-site) Gaps between full width elements and other elements (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-fixing-spacing-and-alignment-issues-on-your-site#gaps-between-full-width-elements-and-other-elements)Alignment issues on different browsersAlthough Wix sites are optimized for most common devices and browsers, you may notice some differences in alignment between them. This is because different browsers and devices use different rendering engines, which can cause minor variations.You can adjust your site elements to ensure their alignment on different browsers by adding them to columns, repeaters, or containers.Solution 1 | Attach elements to columnsAdd strips (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-adding-and-setting-up-a-strip)to your site and split them into columns (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-adding-and-setting-up-columns-on-your-strip). You can define how big you want each column, and attach and arrange elements onto the column to ensure it suits your site's layout. Solution 2 | Attach elements to repeatersA repeater (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-adding-and-managing-repeaters-lists-grids) is a list of items that organizes your elements into templates that have the same design and layout, but different content. You can customize the content, and ensure that the elements are aligned uniformly across each item.Solution 3 | Attach elements to container boxesAdd container boxes (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-adding-and-setting-up-a-box) to your site to attach your elements (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-attaching-elements-to-a-box) to them to easily align them together. We recommend making sure that you leave extra room for text elements inside the box to avoid font issues (https://support.wix.com/en/article/font-looks-different-on-different-browsers). Gaps between the page content and footerYou might notice a small gap between the content of your page and the footer: This can occur due to the page design, or because of the height of the page. The gap can be removed by adjusting the design or height.Solution 1 | Changing the page designSome page designs can cause a gap to occur between the body and the footer. To remove the gap, you can select a different preset design (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-changing-the-page-body-design).Solution 2 | Adjusting the page height Adjusting the height of your page can also remove gaps. This works by getting rid of the space between content on the page, and the footer. To change the length of your page, click and drag the Adjust Page Height icon (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-resizing-your-page-length) . Note: If your page is covered in strips, you will need to click and pull the footer down in order to click the main part of the page.Gaps below the footerThere is always a gap below your footer in the Editor, as it allows you to resize the footer quickly and easily. However, you may notice a gap below the footer on the live version of your site.A space below the footer appears because your site's content is shorter than the viewport height (the length of the screen). You can rectify this issue by adjusting your page length, or by changing your background color.Solution 1 | Change the page background colorYou can change your background color (https://support.wix.com/en/article/changing-your-page-background-color) to match the color of your footer. By matching the colors, it makes the gap less conspicuous as looks as though the footer itself is longer. Solution 2 | Add content to your pageYour page length is automatically determined by the content and elements you add to it. You can make your page longer by adding additional content to cover most of the viewport. Note: If you add extra content to your page, you may still see a gap on larger viewports, and a vertical scrollbar can appear on smaller viewports.Solution 3 | Resize the footerResize your footer (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-customizing-your-site-footer#resizing-the-footer) to make it longer. This can give your page extra length, and may cover the viewport.Footer overlapping elements set to show on all pagesIf you have an element on your site that is set to show on all pages (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-showing-an-element-on-all-pages), you may find that the footer overlaps it on some pages. This can happen if some of your pages are shorter than your element.Solution: To fix the issue, drag your footer down with the Adjust Page Height icon (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-resizing-your-page-length) . Elements disappearing from the site headerYou may find that some of the elements in your header disappear (or fall behind the header) on your live site. This can happen for 2 reasons:\n Your header has a scroll effect that makes it freeze Your element is not set to show on all pages (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-showing-an-element-on-all-pages)You can resolve this issue by changing the header's scroll effect, or adjusting the element's display settings.Solution 1 | Changing the header scroll effectIf your header has a freeze scroll effect, it can cause elements to disappear or fall behind the header. Choose a new scroll effect (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-customizing-your-site-header#adding-a-scroll-effect-to-your-header) to make the elements visible on your live site.Solution 1 | Setting an element to show on all pagesIf your element hasn't been attached to the header, and has not been set to show on all pages, it is not visible on all of your site's pages.Enable Show on All Pages (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-showing-an-element-on-all-pages) on your element to display it on every page of your site.Text misaligned on your live siteSometimes your live site's layout can appear differently on different screens and browsers, with elements not aligning as intended. This may be caused by browsers rendering fonts and other elements differently.You can set a certain height for your text box, ensuring that even if the text becomes slightly larger or smaller on another browser, it does not affect the way the boxes are aligned on the page. To set a height for your text box:\n Click the text box in your Editor. Click and drag the handles on the text box to extend it a bit beyond the end of the text (about 10-20 pixels). This does not affect the size of the text itself.Gaps between full-width elements and other elementsCertain elements can be stretched to full-width on your site, such as lines, horizontal menus, and some galleries. Elements that have this option display a Stretch icon when you click them.When you stretch an element to full width, gaps may appear between the full width element and elements placed above or below it. You can resolve this issue by using the Zoom Out function or moving the element. Solution 1 | Zooming out to remove gapsRemove gaps from your page by clicking the Zoom Out &amp; Reorder on the top bar of your Editor. In this view, you can move full-width elements up or down, or delete the spaces between them (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-removing-gaps-on-your-site). Solution 2 | Manually moving elementsManually move your elements by dragging them to a different position on the page to remove the gaps.

In order to receive payouts to your bank account, your account status (https://support.wix.com/en/article/understanding-the-status-of-your-wix-payments-account) must be Active. Payouts are only made once there's an available balance of at least $1.Payout StagesEach payment from your customer goes through 3 stages before it reaches your bank account. These are:\n Processing payment: After your customer makes a successful payment, the payment is processed. Processing usually takes 2-5 business days and is comprised of 2 parts, which happen simultaneously:\n \n The settlement period, which usually takes 1-2 days, but can take longer depending on your customer\u2019s payment method. At the same time that the payment is settling, it also goes through a pending period in Wix Payments. The pending period usually lasts between 2-5 business days, and exists to protect your business, your customers and Wix Payments from fraudulent activity. Scheduled payout: The payment is added to your next scheduled daily, weekly or monthly (https://support.wix.com/en/article/scheduled-payouts-in-wix-payments) payout.\nNote: If you have more than one payment method active in your Wix Payments account, your payouts may be grouped by payment method. Learn more (https://support.wix.com/en/article/grouped-payment-methods-in-wix-payments). Sent payout: The payout has been sent from Wix Payments and should arrive in your bank account within 3 - 5 business days. Factors such as the day-of-the-week, the currency, or bank holidays will decide the arrival date of your payout.See how payouts are calculatedA payout is the sum of all credits (funds coming in) minus all debits (funds going out).The calculation takes into account the following: \n Credits:\n \n Payments: Funds from payments accepted through Wix Payments. Funds Added: Funds you added to cover a negative balance for a given payment method in your Wix Payments account. Funds Transfer: Funds transferred from Wix to your Wix Payments account. Refund Reversal: Any refunds that have been cancelled. Chargeback Reversal: Any chargebacks (https://support.wix.com/en/article/chargebacks-in-wix-payments) that have been cancelled. (When applicable) Reserve Released: If there are funds released from reserve (https://support.wix.com/en/article/about-reserve-funds-in-your-wix-payments-account), they're added to your next payout. Debits:\n \n Refunds: Any refunds made to your customers. Refund Reversal Fee: The fee for processing the reversal transaction. Chargebacks: Any chargebacks called by your customer's card issuer. Chargeback Fee: The fee for processing a chargeback transaction. Chargeback Reversal Fee: The fee for processing a chargeback reversal transaction. (When applicable) Reserve Held: The portion of the payout that stays in reserve is deducted from the amount. If the resulting sum (credit - debit) is a positive number, the amount is paid out to your bank account, and the payout status switches from Scheduled to Sent.Payout SchedulesThere are three payout schedules you can choose from, depending on the needs of your business: \n Daily: Payouts are sent every day, including transactions that were made before the daily cut-off time*. Any transactions received after that time will be included in the next day's payout. Weekly: Payouts are sent every Monday. You can change this to any other day of the week through your account settings. Monthly: Payouts are sent on the 1st of every month. You can change this to any other day of the month through your account settings. In months with less than 29 days, payouts are sent on the last day of the month.* About the payout cut-off time: Depending on your region, Wix Payments sends payouts every day at the following time:\n US: 6AM EST. Europe: 6AM GMT. You can choose and change your payout schedule at any time from your Wix Payments account settings.

Keeping a percentage of your payouts in reserve lets you easily cover refunds or potential chargebacks from customers.

After 90 days, that money is released, which means it is now available for payout. The In reserve tab shows you how much money is currently held in reserve:In this example, you have a total of $75.00 currently held in reserve.The $75.00 will gradually be released on a rolling basis. In other words:\n The $15.00 which was held from the Jan 4 payout will be released 90 days later on April 4. The $40.00 which was held from the Jan 5 payout will be released 90 days later on April 5. The $20.00 which was held from the Jan 6 payout will be released 90 days later on April 6.After each reserve amount is released, it is added to your next scheduled payout.

When you reactivate a deactivated automation, it will resume collecting trigger data from the point it is reactivated.Examples:\n An automation that sends \""thank you\"" emails following purchases is deactivated on Monday. Jane makes a purchase on Tuesday. The automation is reactivated on Wednesday. Jane won't receive a \""thank you\"" email because the automation couldn't collect the trigger data on the day of Jane's purchase. An automation is created to notify users when a pricing plan has expired. It will only be triggered for those who purchased a pricing plan after the automation was set up. A Wix Bookings automation is set up to trigger when clients are checked in to sessions (https://support.wix.com/en/article/creating-automations-for-wix-bookings). Clients must have attendance marked by a site admin before the session ends to trigger the automation. The same applies for Wix Events automations (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-events-using-wix-automations-to-promote-an-event).Automation is triggering, but automated email isn't sentStep 1 | Check automation statisticsCheck automation statistics to see if the email was sent.You only see unique recipients in automations statistics. If an automation is triggered for the same contact on more than one occasion, it counts as only being sent once.\n Go to Automations (https://www.wix.com/my-account/site-selector/?buttonText=Open%20Wix%20Automations&amp;title=Select%20a%20Site&amp;autoSelectOnSingleSite=true&amp;actionUrl=https://www.wix.com/dashboard/{{metaSiteId}}/triggers/) in your site's dashboard. Scroll down to the Your automations section. Hover over the relevant email automation and click the More Actions icon . Click View email stats to view your email marketing statistics (https://support.wix.com/en/article/viewing-your-email-marketing-statistics).Step 2 | Check the spam folderWhen you set up an automation to send an email to your contact, the email could end up in their spam folder. They (or you, if you're testing the automation) should go to their inbox and look for the email in that folder as well. Learn more about automations sent through Wix Email Marketing being marked as spam (https://support.wix.com/en/article/email-campaigns-marked-as-spam).If checking the spam folder doesn't solve the issue, please whitelist the following emails:\n no-reply@test.wixshoutout.com If you have not set a confirmed reply-to email (https://support.wix.com/en/article/reply-to-email-address-for-email-campaigns): @automations.ascendbywix.com If you have set a confirmed reply-to email (https://support.wix.com/en/article/reply-to-email-address-for-email-campaigns): Your email address.Step 3 | Check that the recipient's email address is activeCheck that the recipient's email address is active and that they've subscribed to your mailing list. If they have, you'll see a \""SUBSCRIBED\"" label on their contact card (https://support.wix.com/en/article/accessing-your-contact-list).If your automation sends an email to an inactive contact (https://support.wix.com/en/article/about-active-and-inactive-contacts), the email will not go through.Step 4 | Check that the recipient's email address is validCheck that the recipient\u2019s email address is valid. If it's not, the recipient won't receive an email (even if the automation was set up correctly).Issues with Wix FormsStep 1 | Check that the form was successfully submittedYou'll be able to see all submissions in your form's submissions table (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-forms-viewing-and-managing-a-submissions-table).Step 2 | Check that the right trigger app is selectedYour trigger app should be Wix Forms, not Site Members or any other app.Step 3 | Check that the right form is selected as part of your triggerIf you've set a specific form to trigger your automation (rather than any form), make sure you've selected the right form.Step 4 | Make sure there is an email/phone field in your formIf your automation's trigger is Form submitted, the trigger is reliant on specific contact details to complete the action. If these contact details are missing, the action cannot be completed.Form requirements for automations:\n Action is Send an email: Form must include an email field. Action is Move card in a workflow: Form must include an email field or phone field. Action is Add a label: Form must include an email field or phone field.Step 5 | Check that the email field is the correct form field typeAccess the form in your Editor to manage its fields (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-forms-managing-your-form-fields). Hover over your email field to make sure its title is Email Field.Step 6 | Check that the email field is synced with an email field in your Contact ListThe email field in your form needs to be synced to your Contact List. The field synced must be either Email or Email (Main). If it\u2019s anything else, it won't work as an email field. After your visitor submits such a form, a contact is not created and an automated email cannot be sent.Learn more about checking and editing form fields (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-forms-saving-your-form-data-to-your-contacts#saving-the-fields-from-your-form-manually).Step 7 | Check if you hold multiple emails addresses for one contactAccess your contact's contact card (https://support.wix.com/en/article/accessing-your-contact-list) to see if you hold multiple email addresses for them. If a contact has multiple email addresses, usually automated emails are sent to an additional email rather than the contact's main/primary email.Contacts you hold only one email address for are not affected.If you're logged in and testing your form using multiple email addresses, your site will recognize that these are all from your login and will merge them under one contact. For this reason, the automation will not be delivering emails as you may expect.Notes:\n Changing your automation timing resets actions that are \""pending\"" for that automation. For example, John has set up an automation that reminds customers about abandoned carts after 3 hours. Mary abandoned her cart at 12pm. If John edits this automation at 2.30pm, changing the action timing to 2 hours, Mary will not be reminded (the point at which Mary's cart was abandoned for 2 hours has already passed). You can test an automation by submitting a test form. Make sure you are logged out of your Wix account before submitting a form to test an automation. If you are logged in when submitting a form, your email address and the test email address will become merged under the same contact. When one contact has multiple email addresses, emails from automations are sent to the email address used when filling in the form.Still not working?If the problem persists, contact us (https://www.wix.com/contact) with a screenshot (https://support.wix.com/en/article/adding-a-screenshot-to-a-ticket) or video (https://support.wix.com/en/article/adding-a-video-to-a-ticket) of the issue (if a video, recreate the issue while recording the steps).",Relevant

My automations are broken,"Online Programs: Creating Automations for Your Program\nSave time by creating automations for your program(s). Each automation starts with a trigger that causes an action to occur in response to the trigger. For example, when a member joins a program, send them a welcome email.You can get as creative as you want when creating an automation to meet the needs of each program. This ranges from sending a notification when a participant misses a step or a chat message thanking a member for paying for a program.Step 1 | Add a new automationEach new automation you create appears in your site's dashboard. Give each one a unique name to keep your automations organized and easy to keep track of.To add a new automation:\n Go to Automations (https://www.wix.com/my-account/site-selector/?buttonText=Open%20Wix%20Automations&amp;title=Select%20a%20Site&amp;autoSelectOnSingleSite=true&amp;actionUrl=https://www.wix.com/dashboard/%7B%7BmetaSiteId%7D%7D/triggers/) in your site's dashboard. Click + New Automation or click an existing automation to edit it. Click + Start from Scratch. Click the title to give your automation a name.Step 2 | Choose a triggerThe trigger is the event that initiates an automatic response. This is something that a member or participant does involving your program. You can choose from a list of available triggers and select which program triggers the automation.To choose a trigger:\n Select Online Programs in the Trigger section. Select the relevant checkbox under Select a trigger for this app and choose a trigger for your automation. Click the Select which programs trigger this automation drop-down and select the relevant program(s):\n \n All Programs: The trigger is active for all programs. Specific Program: You can select draft and published programs. Programs without steps don't appear here.\n \n Click the Select program drop-down. Select the checkbox next to the relevant program. Click Apply. Click the Limit Frequency to drop-down and select how many times the same contact can trigger this automation:\n \n Don't limit (trigger every time): Your action will take place every time it is triggered by a visitor. Once per contact: Your action will take place only once per contact. Oncer per contact every 24 hrs: Your action will take place only once per contact in any 24hr period. Step 3 | Choose the timingYou can choose how much time passes after the trigger, before the action occurs. For example, if your trigger is 'Participant completes a program,' you may want your action to happen right away to congratulate them on a job well done.To choose the timing:\n Click Add Delay. Choose how many days, hours or minutes should pass after the trigger, before the action occurs.Step 4 | Choose an actionAfter choosing a trigger, decide how you want to respond to that trigger. For example, if your trigger is 'Participant completes a step', you can assign a badge to encourage them to continue to the next step.To choose an action:\n Select your desired action in the Action section. Choose an action (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-automations-creating-a-new-automation#step-3-choose-an-action) using the available options.\nTip: For example, if your trigger is 'Participant Misses a Step,' select the 'Send a Chat Message' follow-up action to send a reminder message to those participants. (Optional) Click + Add an Action to set up a multistep automation (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-automations-creating-a-multi-action-automation).\n Tip: For example, add a multistep automation that welcomes members who join your program with a chat message and then sends a follow-up email a few days later encouraging them to start the program.Step 5 | Activate your automationClick Activate to save and activate the automation.

My automations are broken,"Wix Automations: Creating a New Automation\nCreate a new automation based on the way you'd like to grow or manage your business. Choose to create one from scratch or make edits to a suggested automation. When you begin to create an automation, you'll see suggested automations specific to your business type.All automations consist of a trigger and an action. An automation's trigger is the event that causes the action to occur. The action is the response to the trigger.An important factor of an automation is the timing. As the action occurs automatically, the timing needs to be set in advance. The action can take place immediately after the trigger, or after a predefined number of hours or days.Example:Joan has a monthly newsletter. She creates a newsletter subscription form to grow her mailing list. She wants to thank each subscriber as they sign up, but manually sending these emails would be impossible. Instead, she sets up an automation that automatically sends a 'thank you' message every time a new person subscribes.Step 1 | Add a new automationAny automations you create will appear in Automations in your site's dashboard. Make sure to choose a name that's memorable and can be understood by all of your site collaborators.To add a new automation:\n Go to Automations (https://www.wix.com/my-account/site-selector/?buttonText=Open%20Wix%20Automations&amp;title=Select%20a%20Site&amp;autoSelectOnSingleSite=true&amp;actionUrl=https://www.wix.com/dashboard/{{metaSiteId}}/triggers/) in your site's dashboard. Click + New Automation in the top right corner. Click + Start from Scratch.\nNote: To use a suggested automation, search and select from the options under Popular. You can edit the trigger and actions of a suggested automation.\n Click the title to give your automation a name.Step 2 | Choose a triggerThe trigger is the action or event that initiates the automatic response. This may be something that a visitor does on your site (for example, purchasing a product), or something you do (for example, creating an invoice).The triggers you'll see listed differ depending on the app you're using (for example, Wix Forms, Wix Stores). Choose the app and then select one of the available triggers.To choose a trigger:\n Click the app you'd like to base your trigger on in the Trigger section.\n Select your chosen trigger from the available options.\nNote: These options will differ depending on the app you selected in step 1.\n Click the Limit frequency to drop-down to set trigger frequency:\n \n Don't limit (trigger every time): Your action will take place every time it is triggered by a visitor. Once per contact: Your action will take place only once per contact. Once per contact every 24hrs: Your action will take place only once per contact in any 24hr period. Step 3 | (Optional) Add a delayChoose when this action should occur. You may want to perform the action immediately after the trigger occurs, or set a delay to send it after a certain amount of time has passed. For example, if your trigger is \""Customer abandons a cart\"" and your action is \""Send an email\"", you would probably want this to be sent after a certain amount of time has passed.To add a delay to your automation:\n Click + Add Delay. Click the up and down arrows to set the number and click the drop-down to choose between days, hours and minutes.Note:If you don't add a delay, the action is performed as soon as the trigger occurs.Step 4 | (Optional) Add a conditionAfter choosing a trigger, you have the option to add a condition. Conditions allow you to set and manage complex automation flows.For example, you use Wix Restaurants and have introduced a new sharing menu for tables of 4 guests and over. You'd like to send an email update to all customers who have made such bookings. By creating an email automation with the condition that a reservation is for a party size greater than 3, you're targeting this group of customers and not customers who have booked tables for smaller groups.Note:We are currently in the process of releasing conditions, so they are not available for all triggers yet. If you select a trigger and see + Add Condition, you can add a condition.To add a condition:\n Click + Add Condition. Click the Select criteria drop-down and choose the criteria you want to use to decide whether this automation continues each time it's triggered. Click the drop-down that appears next to your criteria drop-down to select your operator (e.g. \""is\"", \""is not\""). Click the drop-down or text box that appears next to your operator drop-down to complete your condition. The logical statement you've created will determine whether the automation continues. (Optional) Click + Add Criteria to add any further criteria.Tip:Learn more about best practices for creating conditions (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-automations-best-practices-for-creating-conditions).Step 5 | Choose an actionAfter choosing a trigger, decide how you want your site to react to that trigger. For example, if your trigger was 'Visitor submits a form on your site', you might want to send that visitor an automatic thank you email.

Learn more in Documenting your Velo Package (https://support.wix.com/en/article/documenting-your-velo-package).Step 4 | Build or Test Your PackageAbout Package VersionsBlocks assigns a version number to every Velo package you create or update. Choose one of two types of versions:\n A minor version. A version with small changes that don't break compatibility. A major version. A version with changes that break backward compatibility. For example, removing a function or changing a function's parameters would require a major version release. Note that first build of a package is always a major version. A test. Testing your package allows you to test the functionality of your package on a site, but it does not create a new version. Learn more about testing your package (https://support.wix.com/en/article/testing-your-velo-package). Blocks automatically updates the version number. For example, if your previous release was 1.0, and you build a minor version, Blocks assigns it the version number 1.1. If your previous release was 2.2, and you build a major version, Blocks assigns it the version number 3.0.You can configure how each of your sites receives updated versions your package (Learn more about updating your package (https://support.wix.com/en/article/updating-your-velo-package)).If you are ready to create a major or minor version, go ahead and build your package (if your are not ready to create a version, you can test your package (https://support.wix.com/en/article/testing-your-velo-package)).

Can clients carry over sessions from a package if they don't use them?If your client doesn't use the sessions within the amount of time you set, the sessions don't carry over. If a client buys a four-session per month package but only attends two sessions, they have access to four sessions the next month, not six.Can clients pay for group bookings using a package?Clients can pay for group bookings using their purchased packages on both desktop and their member apps. Each participant in a group booking uses up 1 session in the package.\n\nFor example, if a client buys a 10-session package and makes a group booking with 2 friends using their package, it counts as 3 sessions used. They then have 7 sessions remaining. \n\nYou can make a group booking on behalf of your client on desktop or using the Wix Owner app. When you book the client in, you can add guests to their booking and redeem all sessions from your client's package.

After your rules are in place, your customers will be able to select how they want to receive their order.Before you begin:\n If you're new to eCommerce, make sure to check how much it actually costs to ship your products to different regions. If you set up shipping and tax options in a merchant account in the past (for example in PayPal), remove these settings before setting up shipping in Wix.Step 1 | Set up your regions Wix Stores comes with two regions already added: One for your own country (the \""Domestic\"" region), and one for the rest of the world (the \""International\"" region). Both offer free shipping by default.From this starting point, you can decide which countries (or regions within countries) you want to ship to.To set up your regions:\n Go to the Shipping &amp; fulfillment (https://www.wix.com/my-account/site-selector/?buttonText=Manage%20Shipping&amp;title=Select%20a%20Site&amp;autoSelectOnSingleSite=true&amp;actionUrl=https://www.wix.com/dashboard/{{metaSiteId}}/store/shipping-and-tax/list?referralInfo=sidebar) settings in your site's dashboard.

Click the All states / provinces checkbox to deselect it. \n Select the checkboxes next to the regions you want to ship to (e.g. California and Oregon). Click Done. Click Save.Ship to a few countries with the same rate for allTo create the same shipping rate for a few countries, create a region made up of those countries. You can then manage settings for these countries as a group.

Create a new rule: Click Add Region. Start typing the name of the first country and select it from the list. Click +Add Destination and start typing the name of another country and select it from the list.

Ship worldwideTo ship worldwide, create as many specific shipping rules as you need (or none at all). Then, make sure the International (Rest of the World) toggle is enabled. In the example below, a merchant from the US has set up free shipping to the US, Mexico, and Canada. Then, they created a region for countries that are relatively close with a $5 flat shipping rate (to 7 Central American countries).Lastly, the international (Rest of the World) region for is enabled, with a flat rate of $10. Note:Can't find the shipping region that you need? Please contact us (https://www.wix.com/support/conversations/category/contact) and let us know which region is missing.

In this article, learn more about:\n Editor performance (https://support.wix.com/en/article/editor-performance-best-practices#editor-performance) Using dynamic pages instead of duplicating pages (https://support.wix.com/en/article/editor-performance-best-practices#using-dynamic-pages-instead-of-duplicating-pages) Using repeaters instead of duplicating elements (https://support.wix.com/en/article/editor-performance-best-practices#using-repeaters-instead-of-duplicating-elements) Using galleries instead of individual images (https://support.wix.com/en/article/editor-performance-best-practices#using-galleries-instead-of-individual-images) Writing blog posts instead of creating new pages (https://support.wix.com/en/article/editor-performance-best-practices#writing-blog-posts-instead-of-creating-new-pages)Editor performanceYour Editor's performance (loading time and reaction time) depends on several local and non-local factors.Local conditionsThe environment in which you edit your site heavily influences the Editor's performance. Local conditions include your computer, browser, internet connection, firewall and more. You can enhance the loading and reaction time of your Editor by improving your local setup. Tip:When editing your site, make sure to use the most recent version of a supported browser (https://support.wix.com/en/article/supported-browsers). Non-local conditionsYour site's content and structure affect the Editor's performance no matter what your local setup consists of. Unlike live sites that load content 1 page at a time, the Editor loads all your site's pages at once. You can improve performance by using less content per page, less static pages, and other load-reducing methods. View the following sections in this article to learn how to better optimize your site's content and structure. Using dynamic pages instead of duplicating pagesInstead of duplicating many pages and changing their content manually, you can use dynamic pages. With dynamic pages, you can reduce the number of static pages on your site and help the Editor perform better. Dynamic pages allow you to reuse the same page layout across multiple pages while showing different content in each. Every dynamic page connects to a collection in your CMS where you add the info you want to display in the page. Learn more about using dynamic pages in your Wix site (https://support.wix.com/en/article/about-dynamic-pages-4488730). Using repeaters instead of duplicating elementsRather than duplicating elements several times, then editing each element's design one by one, use repeaters. By using repeaters to reduce the number of unique elements the Editor needs to load, you can increase the Editor's performance. A repeater is a single element that uses the same layout and design across a list of several items. Each \""item\"" consists of multiple elements such as text boxes, images, and buttons. When you change the layout or design of one item in your repeater, the changes apply to all the items at once. You can also connect repeaters to collections in the CMS (https://support.wix.com/en/article/displaying-collection-content-in-a-repeater) to show dynamic data.Learn more about adding and managing repeaters (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-adding-and-managing-repeaters-lists-grids).Using galleries instead of individual imagesRather than adding many separate image elements to a page, add the images to a single gallery. This improves the Editor's performance, as it loads one element instead of several. You can also connect galleries to collections in the CMS (https://support.wix.com/en/article/displaying-collection-content-in-a-gallery) to display images dynamically.Learn more about adding galleries to your site (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-adding-a-gallery). Writing blog posts instead of creating new pagesIf you're frequently adding fresh content to new pages on your site, consider writing blog posts instead. The Wix Blog uses a single dynamic page to load each of your posts. This means less pages for your Editor to load, resulting in better performance. Learn more about adding and setting up a blog (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-blog-adding-and-setting-up-your-blog).

The goal is to show up on Google (and other search engines) when potential customers are searching for services like yours. To help you achieve this, we've assembled a comprehensive guide that explains fundamental SEO best practices and expert insights on harnessing the power of Wix tools.Want to learn more about SEO?Check out our complete Wix SEO guide (https://www.wix.com/seo/learn/resource/wix-seo-guide) with everything you need to know about our SEO features and capabilities, along with how you can use them to optimize your site. SEO best practicesThere is a set of practices aimed at improving your website's visibility in search engine results pages. Remember that SEO is an ongoing process, and results may take time to materialize. Staying up-to-date with industry trends and algorithm updates is crucial to maintaining and improving your website's search engine rankings. Below are some SEO best practices you should consider.Before you begin:Make sure that you have set your site to be found by search engines (https://support.wix.com/en/article/enabling-search-engines-like-google-to-index-your-site).Create quality contentLet's talk about the magic ingredient\u2014quality content. It's the key to climbing the Google ranks. If you ever find yourself wondering why you're not ranking as high as you'd like, consider taking another look at your list of target keywords. Put yourself in your customer's shoes and ask, \""What would one of my customers type into Google when looking for a business like mine?\""Content is at the heart of SEO. Create high-quality content that not only incorporates your target keywords but also provides valuable information, answers questions, and engages your audience. For example, make sure your products or services have clear descriptions, and write engaging blog posts. Consistency in content creation is essential for building authority.Google tends to favor sites that are well-written and frequently updated content. Regularly publishing blog posts, ones that your target audience will enjoy or find informative, is a very effective way of doing so. It helps attract and engage your target audience and get links (backlinks) to your site from relevant or reputable sites. This improves your online reputation and credibility, increasing your chances of ranking higher in search results.Learn how to add and set up Wix Blog (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-blog-adding-and-setting-up-your-blog).Research keywordsConduct thorough research to identify the most relevant and valuable keywords for your website. Understanding what terms your target audience uses will guide you in creating content that aligns with their interests and needs. Use Wix's integration with SEMrush (https://support.wix.com/en/article/using-wixs-semrush-integration-to-find-keywords-for-your-site) to discover descriptive and intricate keyword strings, ensuring your content addresses the depth and complexity of user search queries, moving beyond basic terms like 'shoes'. It can help you discover valuable keywords that strike a balance between search volume and competition. Remember, the strategic use of long-tail keywords, which are longer and more specific keyword phrases, can significantly boost your online visibility and engagement. For example, instead of targeting the broad keyword 'shoes,' you could use a long-tail keyword like 'best running shoes for flat feet.' This caters to a more specific audience looking for precisely what your site offers. Long-tail keywords allow your site's content to align more closely with the unique queries that users enter into search engines. This, in turn, increases the likelihood of your site appearing in relevant search results and attracting highly targeted traffic.Add keywords to your site's pagesIt's not just about having keywords; it's about using them thoughtfully. Take a look through your website and make sure you've sprinkled those keywords where they belong. That means in your headlines, body text and more. The trick is to make it all sound natural, like a friendly conversation with your visitors.Remember, keywords should be optimized at the page level, not the site level. Each page can and should be tailored to different keywords within a related topic. It's not about repeating the same word excessively but ensuring that each page thoroughly explores a specific topic or keyword to enhance its relevance and user experience.Optimize on-page SEOOptimize on-page elements like title tags, meta descriptions, headers, and URLs with your chosen keywords. These elements provide search engines with valuable context about your content, making it easier for them to rank your pages in search results.

Google rewards websites that prioritize user satisfaction with higher rankings.Update your business information (for local businesses)For businesses with physical locations, optimizing your Google My Business listing and maintaining consistent business information (Name, Address, Phone Number) across the web is crucial for local search visibility.You can manage your Google Business Profile details in your Wix account.

With the increasing use of mobile devices for browsing, Google prioritizes mobile-friendly websites in its rankings. Just remember to publish your site (https://support.wix.com/en/article/publishing-your-site-6980885) after making any edits or changes.Utilize social media &amp; promotionsDon't just publish content; actively promote it through various channels, such as social media, email marketing, and outreach to industry influencers. Promotion helps your content reach a wider audience and attract more traffic. Encourage social sharing of your content as it can indirectly impact SEO by increasing visibility and driving more traffic to your site.

get found on google,"Optimizing Your Site's Content for SEO\nOne of the best ways to get your site to rank higher in search engine results (https://support.wix.com/en/article/getting-your-site-found-on-google-seo-best-practices) is by adding original text to each page. Not sure where to start? Follow the steps below to get the most out of your site\u2019s content.Learn more about:\n How search engines use your content (https://support.wix.com/en/article/optimizing-your-sites-content-for-seo#how-search-engines-use-your-content) Optimizing your content for search engines (https://support.wix.com/en/article/optimizing-your-sites-content-for-seo#optimizing-your-content-for-search-engines)How search engines use your contentSearch engines like Google crawl and index (https://www.wix.com/seo/learn/resource/intro-to-crawling-indexing-ranking-for-seo) each page on your site individually. When someone enters a search term, the search engine tries to understand their intent and gives them the most relevant results for their query.The rank of your page in those results depends on the quality of your content and how relevant it is to certain keywords (https://support.wix.com/en/article/adding-keywords-search-phrases). Optimizing your content for search enginesBe originalCreating original content for each page of your site is a great way to rank higher. It\u2019s important to use your page\u2019s keywords in a natural, unforced way. One way you can do this is by describing the main purpose of your site in different ways.For example, if you own an automobile repair shop, you can sprinkle your text with a variety of keywords like: \n Car &amp; auto services Professional mechanics Reliable repairs Auto specialistsSearch engines also assign a higher value to quality content, so avoid lists of keywords or repeating the same text on multiple pages. Duplicating content from other sites is also something to avoid. Search engines can recognize duplicate content and may penalize your site.Be descriptiveGo into as much detail as you can about what you do, what services or products you offer, and what your users can get from your site. Here are a few ideas to make your site more descriptive:\n Add accurate title tags (https://support.wix.com/en/article/adding-SEO-page-titles-and-descriptions-meta-tags) for each page Create separate pages for different products, services, and topics Imagine yourself in your site visitor\u2019s place and write the information you would want to knowGive the people what they wantWe recommend writing content that answers popular questions related to your keywords. It\u2019s a great way to draw visitors to your site by giving them the help they need. It also proves to search engines that your site has value and is worth ranking higher.Give the people what they want (regularly)You should also create fresh content for your site on a regular basis. Update your site regularly with changes in your business, new projects you\u2019re working on, and new products or services your customers can buy.Some other ways you can keep your site up to date are: \n Creating a blog (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-blog-about-the-wix-blog) for news updates and new trends Making an FAQs page (https://support.wix.com/en/article/adding-and-setting-up-the-wix-faq-app) to help customers with common questions Adding a testimonials page (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-adding-customer-testimonials-to-your-site) for customer reviewsFor example, if you sell auto accessories, you can add a blog about the latest customization trends.Put the most important information in writingRich content like videos, animations, and audio clips can help keep visitors on your site for longer, but search engines don\u2019t easily understand them. Use text for important information as much as possible.If you use a graphic or logo for your site\u2019s name, make sure to add alt text to it (https://support.wix.com/en/article/optimizing-your-images-and-galleries-for-SEO-alt-text). You should also include the site's name as text somewhere else on the page.Use heading tagsThe H1 tag, also known as a heading tag, acts as the title of each page. The H1 tag should be the headline of a page, similar to the headline of a page of a newspaper.Each page of your site should have its own unique heading tags. The heading tag should describe the content of each page. This helps both search engines and site visitors understand what each page is about. Learn more about heading tags (https://support.wix.com/en/article/about-heading-tags)Use data from a Wix Site Search barAdding a Wix Site Search bar to your site (https://support.wix.com/en/article/wix-editor-about-wix-site-search#adding-wix-site-search-1) lets your visitors find what they are looking for more easily. You can also use Wix Site Search to optimize your content by using the Wix Analytics reports (https://support.wix.com/en/article/about-wix-analytics-reports) it generates to see the most common search terms that your visitors use.For example, you can use your Top Searches report (https://support.wix.com/en/article/understanding-wix-analytics-behavior-reports#top-searches) to identify the search phrases your site visitors use most. This can help you understand what they really want to find on your site. If the top search phrase on your site is \""car repairs\"", you might want to create more content on your site related to this topic, or add the phrase to your homepage's meta description (https://support.wix.com/en/article/adding-seo-title-tags-and-meta-descriptions-meta-tags).On the other hand, the Searches with No Results report (https://support.wix.com/en/article/understanding-wix-analytics-behavior-reports#searches-with-no-results) can help you see gaps in the content on your site. If the top result in this report is \""vehicle recovery\"", it means that your visitors are searching for this topic but can't find any content related to it on your site. You can add new content about this topic that your visitors will find when they search for the phrase.The Searches with No Results report can also help you identify whether you're getting the right kind of traffic to your site. For example, if the top result in this report is \""boat repairs\"" and your main business is car repairs, it might show that you need to adjust the keywords that you focus on in your content.

For example, this could mean they saw it in Google search results or in Google Discover (https://blog.google/products/search/introducing-google-discover/) on an Android device. The visitor does not need to click your link for the impression to count.Exactly when Google counts the impression is different in each type search result. On the All tab of Google Search, your page gets an impression as soon as a visitor opens the search results page where your site is listed. However, on the Images tab of Google Search, more results load infinitely as the visitor scrolls down.

CNAME records: Also known as canonical name records, these are used to create aliases that point to other names. They are commonly used to map WWW, FTP and MAIL sub-domains to a domain.\nNote: Your A and CNAME records are essential to keeping your site online, as well for transferring or connecting your site to another host. MX records: Mail Exchange (MX) records control which mail server your domain uses to receive email, and ensures that you receive emails properly. TXT records: TXT (text) records are used to provide textual information about a domain (like the name of the host and contact details) to external sources. They are also used to provide information to the SPF email authentication system. SPF records: Sender Policy Framework (SPF) is an email validation system designed to prevent email spam by verifying sender IP addresses. SPF records specify which hosts are allowed to send mail from a given domain. SRV records: Also known as service records, these are responsible for localizing specific domain-related services such as FTP, HTTP, and SIP.

Before viewing the records you must first confirm your email address with a confirmation code.To get your DNS records:\n Go to Email Marketing (https://www.wix.com/my-account/site-selector/?buttonText=Email%20Marketing%20Dashboard&amp;title=Select%20a%20Site&amp;autoSelectOnSingleSite=true&amp;actionUrl=https://www.wix.com/dashboard/%7B%7BmetaSiteId%7D%7D/shoutout/) in your site's dashboard. Under Sender Details at the right, click Add Details. \nNote: If you've previously entered an email address, click Edit Details instead. Enter a From name in the field. Recipients see this name as the email sender. Enter a Reply-to email. Use the email address that is connected to your custom domain. Click Save.\n Confirm your email address by entering a confirmation code. The code is sent to the address you just added. Paste the code into the field and click Confirm. Once your email is confirmed you will see 'Not authenticated' under Domain status. Click Authenticate this domain. A list of CNAME records opens. This is the information you need to copy and paste into your external domain provider settings. Keep this information available as you move to the next step.Tip:You can also find the DNS records by clicking Edit under Customize sender details when setting up an email automation. Go to Automations (https://www.wix.com/my-account/site-selector/?buttonText=Open%20Wix%20Automations&amp;title=Select%20a%20Site&amp;autoSelectOnSingleSite=true&amp;actionUrl=https://www.wix.com/dashboard/%7B%7BmetaSiteId%7D%7D/triggers/) in your site's dashboard to get started.\nStep 2 | Sign in to your external domain provider and go to your DNS settingsNote:Depending on the domain provider, domain authentication process might be slightly different from what is described in this article. There might also be some other specific steps you need to take in your domain provider account that are not described in this article. In case your domain is still not authenticated, please contact your domain provider.Once you have the DNS records provided by Wix, go to your external domain provider (e.g. GoDaddy.com) and sign in to your account.Locate the DNS settings of your account. Once you find the DNS records, you are ready to copy and paste the Wix provided records from Step 1 into the relevant fields. The below image is an example of the DNS Records settings from GoDaddy.com.Step 3 | Copy and paste the Wix records into your domain provider settingsNow that you have both your Wix records and the DNS settings of your domain provider open, copy the CNAME record from Wix and paste it into the corresponding fields of your domain provider settings.Important:You must add the CNAME Host and Points to values into the DNS settings exactly as they appear in the Wix records. Once you've copied all the records exactly as they appear, click the confirm message in your domain provider DNS settings.Step 4 | Wait for the records to propagate Once you've copied the DNS records over to your domain provider it can take a few hours for the records to propagate and the authentication to be completed. If you don't see it, allow up to 24 hours for the authentication to be completed.You can always check the status of the domain in your Email Marketing dashboard (https://www.wix.com/my-account/site-selector/?buttonText=Email%20Marketing%20Dashboard&amp;title=Select%20a%20Site&amp;autoSelectOnSingleSite=true&amp;actionUrl=https://www.wix.com/dashboard/%7B%7BmetaSiteId%7D%7D/shoutout/) under Sender Details. Refresh the page to see Domain status.FAQsWe are here to help with all your questions. Click a question below to learn more.Why do I need to authenticate my custom domain?If you are sending emails from a domain that isn't authenticated, email providers may consider these emails as suspicious. This can cause them to be more likely marked as spam and land in spam folders.Receiving mail servers look to verify incoming emails by looking at the sending reputation associated with the sending domain and sending IP address. You increase your deliverability chances (https://support.wix.com/en/article/improving-the-deliverability-of-your-campaign) and improve sender reputation (https://support.wix.com/en/article/improving-your-email-sender-reputation) by authenticating your domain.What is a CNAME record?A CNAME is a type of DNS record that allows Wix to authenticate an email domain. When you add records provided by Wix into your domain host settings, it helps with domain authentication. Once the records are propagated, email providers recognize your emails sent using Wix as genuine and trustworthy.",Irrelevant
